    <p>
      Video game music (VGM) is the soundtrack that accompanies video games.
      Early video game music was once limited to sounds of early sound chips,
      such as programmable sound generators (PSG) or FM synthesis chips. These
      limitations have led to the style of music known as chiptune, which became
      the sound of the first video games. With technological advances, video
      game music has grown to include a wider range of sounds. Players can hear
      music in video games over a game's title screen, menus, and gameplay. Game
      soundtracks can also change depending on a player's actions or situation,
      such as indicating missed actions in rhythm games, informing the player
      they are in a dangerous situation, or rewarding them for specific
      achievements. Video game music can be one of two kinds: original or
      licensed. The popularity of video game music has created education and job
      opportunities, generated awards, and led video game soundtracks to be
      commercially sold and performed in concerts.
